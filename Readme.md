# Warsaw Custom GTFS feeds

Why?

Some public transport agencies don't offer GTFS feeds, this project attempts at filling this void, by creating those feeds, either manually or automatically.

## Feeds

1. `warsaw-ferries` - [direct feed url](https://kasmar00.github.io/gtfs-warsaw-custom/feeds/warsaw-ferries/latest.zip)

    Manually created feed for water transport being part of _Warszawskie Linie Turystyczne_, which is not included in regular Warsaw GTFS feed.
